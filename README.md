Fake News Detection using Machine Learning is a project that classifies news as fake or real using NLP and supervised ML models. It applies TF-IDF feature extraction and deploys the trained model through Gradio, Flask, and FastAPI for real-time prediction and practical use.
Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning is a project developed to automatically classify news articles as fake or real by applying supervised machine learning techniques with Natural Language Processing (NLP). Due to the rapid spread of misinformation on digital platforms, identifying unreliable news has become a major challenge. This project uses traditional machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Passive Aggressive Classifier, selected based on insights from existing research that highlights their strong performance in fake news detection tasks.

Textual news data is preprocessed using standard NLP techniques and transformed into numerical features through Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to capture important linguistic patterns. The trained model is deployed using Gradio, Flask, and FastAPI, enabling real-time prediction through interactive interfaces and APIs. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable classification results, demonstrating the practical application of machine learning in addressing misinformation.
